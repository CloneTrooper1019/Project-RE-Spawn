#PROJECT RESPAWN

A Unity game where you die to progress.
Created by 4 High School students for a Game Design class.

We weren't sure whether or not we wanted to make this open source as we were thinking about potentially doing a steam release, 
but we ultimately decided that in order for us to make the game as good as we'd like it to be, we'd probably need to rebuild
the game from the ground up.
